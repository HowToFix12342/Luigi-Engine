# Luigi Engine (Beta)
Luigi Engine (aka MarioEngine-x-Psych) is a Psych Engine (Mod/Engine) heavaly inspired by Unkown Engine

# Features
- Weekend1 Update
- Pitstop Update (maybe)
- Stuff From Other Engines
- LUA (obviously)
- And More!

# How does it work?
Unlike your typical engine, it is a mod folder so you use Luigi Engine as a Back-End for Psych Engine
That means all mods are Psych Engine Compatible! Most psych ports/mods should work!
